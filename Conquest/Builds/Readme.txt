HOW TO PLAY

Overview:
You begin by controlling a planet. Your objective is to conquer all the other planets on the map.
The enemy also starts with a planet and will try to conquer the map. Planets produce ships. The 
more planets you control, the more ships you'll produce to destroy the enemy.

Player Actions:
Click on a planet you control to select it.
Click on empty space to deselect all planets.
With a planet selected, click on an enemy planet to attack with all the ships from your selected planets.
